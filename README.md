## What, SBA318 again?

I got 1080ยบ turned around, several times, working on all the wrong things.
I need to get away from the computer once my ADD meds wear off, I just wreck the place.
Trying to salvage what I can from https://github.com/coreyfeder/ps_rest-express.git and https://github.com/coreyfeder/ps_Express1.git, and the things I accidentally put in https://github.com/coreyfeder/ps_319SBA_MongoDB.git

* Create a server application with Node and Express.
* Create a RESTful API using Express.
* Create Express middleware.
* Use Express middleware.
* [X] Use a template engine to render views with Express.
* Interact with a self-made API through HTML forms.


## Instructions, Abridged

Create a small Node and Express server application.
Get functionality in place before worrying about filling it with something interesting.
